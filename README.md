# Mobile Robots for Critical Missions Project

Source code for the project work of Mobile Robots for Critical Missions.




## Requirements

Python version: 3.10 <br />
Python libraries for QReader: pyzbar, pytorch, qrdet, numpy <br />
Python software suite for QReader: zbar-tools, to install through 
```
sudo apt-get install zbar-tools 
```
command.

## How to launch

First of all the localization, nav2 and rviz node should be brought up, by using the startup launch file created:
```
ros2 launch planner_pkg startup_launch.py
```
And if all the nodes are started correctly, the discovery and planner package are needed to correctly solve the task:
```
ros2 launch discovery_pkg discovery_launch.py
ros2 launch planner_pkg planner_launch.py
```
If the task should be performed in a simulation environment, the gazebo simulator will be used, by launching:

ros2 launch diem_gazebo turtlebot4_ignition_no_dock.launch.py x:=-6.3 y:=0.0 world:=diem_map

When all the nodes are up, to start the navigation just estimate the initial pose on Rviz.
