## config_pkg
This package was defined to manage system configuration parameters, such as the parameters of the nav2. The second role of this package is to contain the map of the DIEM, which is used by the Navigation Stack to plan the robotâ€™s movements and to localize the robot in the environment. The given map provided during the course has been cleared of certain objects or rather, obstacles, that did not allow the robot to explore properly. In particular, these are the door latches, which, mapped as solid obstacles, did not allow the robot to move correctly in some places like crossing entrances. After testing that the robot also moved over them, it was decided to remove them from the map so that the robot could move correctly. This was done through the use of the tool GIMP, which allowed us to modify the map image and remove the obstacles.
